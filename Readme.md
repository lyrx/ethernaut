# Solving The Ethernaut

The [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) is a
Web3/Solidity based wargame 
inspired by overthewire.org, played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. 
Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.
The game is 100% open source and all levels are 
contributions made by other players.
